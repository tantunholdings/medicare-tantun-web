      title: "21. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration",
      content:
        "      <p><strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Tantun in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Tantun agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TANTUN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>            <p><strong>Exceptions.</strong> Despite the provisions of Section 21.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim (including any claim based on the unauthorized use of the Service).</p>            <p><strong>Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and Tantun will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively AAA Rules) of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) as modified by these Terms and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Tantun. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>            <p><strong>Notice; Process.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or electronic mail (Notice). Tantun address for Notice is: [insert address] or [insert email address]. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (Demand). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Tantun may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Tantun must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Tantun will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Tantun in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator award; or (iii) $1000.</p>            <p><strong>Fees.</strong> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Tantun will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than $15,000, or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to</p>            <p>be agreed upon in [insert county], [insert state], but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Tantun for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding, and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator ruling on the merits.</p>            <p><strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND TANTUN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Tantun agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>            <p><strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Tantun makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Tantun address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Tantun address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Tantun.</p>            <p><strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section 21.6 is found to be unenforceable, or if the entirety of this Section 21 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 21 will be null and void. In that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 19 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.</p>            <p><strong>Opt Out.</strong> Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms. If you do not want to be subject to this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision, you may opt out of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision by notifying Tantun in writing of your decision either by sending within thirty (30) days of the date you accept these Terms (1) an electronic message to [insert email address] stating clearly your name and intent to opt out of the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision, or (2) a letter sent by overnight mail by any nationally recognized delivery service (e.g., UPS, Federal Express, etc.) or by hand delivery to: [insert address]. In order to be effective, the letter under option (2) must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision and must be dated and signed. If emailed or hand-delivered, the signed letter must be received within thirty (30) days of your acceptance of these Terms. If sent by overnight delivery service, the letter must be submitted for delivery to the delivery service within thirty (30) days from the date you accept these Terms. Should you choose not to opt out of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision within the 30-day period, you and Tantun will be bound by the terms of this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision. You understand that you will not be subject to retaliation if you exercise your right to opt out of coverage under this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration provision.</p>            ",
