6. How We Use Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Tools
We (and authorized third parties) use cookies and other tracking technologies on our websites, mobile application, online advertisements, and other online properties (“Digital Properties”) to collect information about you, your device, and how you interact with our Digital Properties. This section contains additional information about:
The types of tracking technologies we use and the purposes for which we use them
The types of information we collect using these technologies
How we disclose or make information available to others
Choices you may have regarding these technologies
Types of Cookies and Tracking Technologies We Use
Our Digital Properties and the third parties that we authorize may use the following tracking technologies:
Cookies, which are a type of technology that install a small amount of information on a user’s computer or other device when they visit a website. Some cookies exist only during a single session and some are persistent over multiple sessions over time.
Pixels, web beacons, and tags, which are types of code or transparent graphics. In addition to the uses described below, these technologies provide analytical information about the user experience and help us customize our marketing activities. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixels, web beacons, and tags are embedded invisibly on web pages.
Session replay tools, which record your interactions with our Digital Properties, such as how you move throughout our Digital Properties and engage with our webforms. In addition to the uses described below, this information helps us improve our Digital Properties and identify and fix technical issues visitors may be having with our Digital Properties.
Embedded scripts and SDKs, which allow us to build and integrate custom apps and experiences, some of which may be developed by a third party.
Purposes for Using These Technologies
We and authorized third parties use these technologies for purposes including:
Personalization, such as remembering user preferences, login details and browsing behavior; tracking your activity across online properties and platforms over time to better understand your preferences and interests; and personalizing online content;
Improving performance, such as maintaining and improving the performance of our Digital Properties;
Analytics, such as analyzing how our websites are used. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us improve our Digital Properties’ performance and user experiences. Google Analytics may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit: “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners;
Advertising, such as providing you with offers that may be of interest to you; conducting targeted advertising to you on our Digital Properties and those of third parties, including jointly marketing the products and services of our and other businesses; and measuring the effectiveness of our communications with you and advertising campaigns, including identifying how and when you engage with our communications.
Information Collected
These tracking technologies collect data about you and your device, such as your IP address, location (both approximate and precise), cookie ID, device ID, AdID, operating system, browser used, browser history, search history, and information about how you interact with our Digital Properties (such as pages on our Digital Properties that you have viewed).
Disclosures of Your Information
We may disclose information to third parties or allow third parties to directly collect information using these technologies on our Digital Properties, such as social media companies, advertising networks, companies that provide analytics including ad tracking and reporting, security providers, and others that help us operate our business and Digital Properties. These companies may use these technologies to gather information about both your visits to our Digital Properties and your visits elsewhere on the Internet, including to provide you with more relevant advertising in what is known as interest-based advertising.
Your Choices
Some of the companies that perform advertising-related services for us may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) and/or Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The DAA and NAI provide mechanisms for you to opt out of interest-based advertising performed by members at http://www.aboutads.info/choices and https://optout.networkadvertising.org/. You may also click on the AboutAds icon on advertisements and follow the instructions on how to opt out. Opting out of interest-based advertising will not opt you out of all advertising, but rather only interest-based advertising from us or our agents or representatives. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
You can also refuse or delete cookies using your browser settings. If you refuse or delete cookies, some of our website functionality may be impaired. If you change computers, devices, or browsers, or use multiple computers, devices, or browsers, and delete your cookies, you may need to repeat this process for each computer, device, or browser. Please refer to your browser’s Help instructions to learn more about how to manage cookies and the use of other tracking technologies.
Some browsers have incorporated Do Not Track (“DNT”) preferences. Most of these features, when turned on, send signals to the website you are visiting that you do not wish to have information about your online searching and browsing activities collected and used. As there is not yet a common agreement about how to interpret DNT signals, we do not honor DNT signals from website browsers at this time.
7. Security
We maintain reasonable security procedures and technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, disclosure, access, alteration, or use. Nevertheless, transmission via the Internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and we do not guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.
8. Children’s Privacy
Interactions with us are intended for individuals 16 years of age and older.  Our interactions are not directed at, marketed to, nor intended for, children under 16 years of age.  We do not knowingly collect any information, including personal information, from children under 16 years of age.  If you believe that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 16, please contact us at the address below and we will use reasonable efforts to delete the child’s information from our databases.  
9.  External Links
When interacting with us you may encounter links to external sites or other online services, including those embedded in third-party advertisements or sponsored content which we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices and data collection policies for such third-party services. You should consult the privacy statements of those third-party services for details.
